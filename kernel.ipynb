This dataset contains information about three different types of Iris flowers:\n\n* Iris Versicolor\n* Iris Virginica\n* Iris Setosa\n\nThe data set contains measurements of four variables :\n\n* sepal length \n* sepal width\n* petal length \n* petal width\n \nThe Iris data set has a number of interesting features:\n\n1. One of the classes (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two. However, the other two classes are not linearly separable.\n\n2. There is some overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica classes, so it is unlikely to achieve a perfect classification rate.\n\n3. There is some redundancy in the four input variables, so it is possible to achieve a good solution with only three of them, or even (with difficulty) from two, but the precise choice of best variables is not obvious.\n\n**Why am I  using iris dataset:**\n\n1- This is a good project because it is so well understood.\n\n2- Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.\n\n3- It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\n\n4- It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.\n\n5- It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).\n\n6- All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.[5]\n\n7- we can define problem as clustering(unsupervised algorithm) project too.\n<a id=\"5\"></a> <br>\n### 3-2 Aim\nThe aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals\n<a id=\"6\"></a> <br>\n### 3-3 Variables\nThe variables are :\n**sepal_length**: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.\n**sepal_width**: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.\n**petal_length**: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.\n**petal_width**: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.\n**setosa**: Iris setosa, true or false, used as target.\n**versicolour**: Iris versicolour, true or false, used as target.\n**virginica**: Iris virginica, true or false, used as target."

It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers in three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\".\nThe data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.\n\nAs a result, **iris dataset is used as the input of all algorithms**.\n![iris](https://image.ibb.co/gbH3ue/iris.png)\n[image source](https://rpubs.com/wjholst/322258)\n<a id=\"9\"></a> <br>\n### 4-2 Outputs\nthe outputs for our algorithms totally depend on the type of classification or clustering algorithms.\nthe outputs can be the number of clusters or predict for new input.\n\n**setosa**: Iris setosa, true or false, used as target.\n**versicolour**: Iris versicolour, true or false, used as target.\n**virginica**: Iris virginica, true or false, used as a target."

We continuously need to predict correct values, impute missing ones, and find links between various data artefacts such as schemas and records. We need to stop treating data cleaning as a piecemeal exercise (resolving different types of errors in isolation), and instead leverage all signals and resources (such as constraints, available statistics, and dictionaries) to accurately predict corrective actions.\n\nThe primary goal of data cleaning is to detect and remove errors and **anomalies** to increase the value of data in analytics and decision making. While it has been the focus of many researchers for several years, individual problems have been addressed separately. These include missing value imputation, outliers detection, transformations, integrity constraints violations detection and repair, consistent query answering, deduplication, and many other related problems such as profiling and constraints mining.[8]"

The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\nIn k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\nIn k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms."

Such a meta-estimator can typically be used as a way to reduce the variance of a black-box estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it.\n\nThis algorithm encompasses several works from the literature. When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the samples, then this algorithm is known as Pasting . If samples are drawn with replacement, then the method is known as Bagging . When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the features, then the method is known as Random Subspaces . Finally, when base estimators are built on subsets of both samples and features, then the method is known as Random Patches .[http://scikit-learn.org]"
